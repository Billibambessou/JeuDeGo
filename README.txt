Introduction to the Game of Go
Go is an abstract strategy board game for two players, in which the aim is to surround more territory than the opponent. The game was invented in China more than 2,500 years ago and is believed to be the oldest board game continuously played to the present day.

Game Rules
Game Board: Go is played on a grid of black lines (usually 19x19). Game pieces, called stones, are played on the intersections of the lines.

Starting the Game: The game begins with an empty board. Black makes the first move, after which White and Black alternate.

Playing the Game: A move consists of placing one stone of one's own color on an empty intersection on the board.

Capturing Stones: Stones are captured and removed from the board when they are completely surrounded by stones of the opposing color. This is known as being 'atari'.

Forbidden Moves: A move that would recreate a previous board position is forbidden. This rule, called the 'ko rule', prevents unending repetition.

Ending the Game: Players may agree at any time to end the game, after which the territory is counted to determine the winner.

Scoring: The player with the larger total of territory and captured stones is the winner.

Strategy and Tactics
Go is a game of strategy. The large board and wide freedom of choice allow for a great depth of tactical and strategic fight. The key to victory is controlling more territory than your opponent.
